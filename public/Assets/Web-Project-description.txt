Extra Details:

To-Do List Detail View: 
•	This is where the "expandable view" comes in.
•	Not a separate page in the traditional sense. Instead, it's a dynamic section within the To-Do Page.
•	When a user clicks on a to-do list on the To-Do Page, this section expands (or a modal/overlay appears) to show: 
o	All tasks within that list.
o	Add/edit/delete tasks.
o	Mark tasks as complete, set due dates/priorities, etc.
•	This keeps the user within the To-Do Page for a smoother experience.
•	the To-Do List Detail View is not a separate, distinct page that the browser loads as a new URL.
Navigation Consistency: Ensure consistent navigation elements (e.g., a sidebar or header) are present across most pages to help users move between sections easily.
If you don't think your users need folder for notes’ organization, you could simplify by:
1.	Removing the Folders table entirely and just using tags for organization
2.	Simplifying to just a "category" field in the Notes table without the nested folder capability
